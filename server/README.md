### Guide for pushing into repo:
* Since we are using Node.js, it is expected for you to install dependencies through npm
* Keeping that in mind, please DO NOT push the node_modules folder, and just keep the package.json and package-lock.json
* Reference to what the repo should look like: https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-react
